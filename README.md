## Real-time Streamlit, GitHub Actions, and PostgreSQL

### Overview

This project showcases the integration of various technologies to build a real-time application. It includes a Streamlit-based world clock that updates the time every second for selected locations around the globe. Additionally, it demonstrates the use of GitHub Actions for automating Python scripts to run periodically, alongside the setup and connection to a PostgreSQL server hosted on Azure.

- **app.py**: The Streamlit application for the world clock.
- **hello.py**: Demonstrates GitHub Actions by printing "Hello, World!" periodically.
- **requirements.txt**: Specifies the Python packages required for the project.
- **.github/workflows/schedule.yml**: Configures GitHub Actions to schedule tasks.
- **README.md**: Provides documentation and overview of the project.

### Lessons Learned

Throughout this lab, I have learned to:

- Utilize Streamlit to create dynamic, real-time web applications.
- Configure GitHub Actions to automate Python script execution at specific intervals.
- Deploy and manage a PostgreSQL database on Azure, understanding cloud-based database services.
- Implement secure database connections and manage environmental variables for deployment.

### Questions

Some areas of inquiry and potential improvement include:

- Exploring methods to reduce latency in real-time data updates within Streamlit apps.
- Investigating best practices for database connection security in cloud-hosted applications.
- Extending GitHub Actions for advanced data processing tasks before database insertion.
